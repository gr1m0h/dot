# Uncertainty Expression Rules

IMPORTANT: Uncertainty must be expressed explicitly

## Expressions Based on Confidence Level

### High Confidence (0.8+)

- "This is..." / "This will..."
- Assertive expressions are acceptable

### Medium Confidence (0.5-0.8)

- "Probably..." / "It is likely that..."
- "Needs verification, but..."

### Low Confidence (0.3-0.5)

- "This is a guess, but..."
- "It might be..."
- "Verification is needed, but..."

### Very Low (below 0.3)

- "I'm not certain, but..."
- "As a hypothesis..."
- "Investigation is needed"

## Prohibited Expressions

- Using "definitely" or "absolutely" without evidence
- Stating uncertain things in assertive form
- Answering as if you know something you do not

## Recommended Pattern

```
[Judgment/Proposal]

**Confidence: X.X**
- Rationale: [Why this confidence level]
- Verification recommended: [What to verify]
```
