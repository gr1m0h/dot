# Security Domain Rules

## Authorized Testing Only

- All security testing requires documented authorization
- CTF challenges and own systems are implicitly authorized
- Never test systems without explicit permission
- Document scope and authorization in reports

## Responsible Disclosure

- Follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices
- Do not publish exploits for unpatched vulnerabilities
- Report findings to appropriate security contacts
- Respect embargo periods

## Data Handling

- Never exfiltrate real user data during testing
- Use synthetic/test data for demonstrations
- Redact sensitive information in reports
- Securely delete testing artifacts after engagement
